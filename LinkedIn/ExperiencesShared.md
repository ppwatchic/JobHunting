实现binary search tree 要求有find insert delete . 
2. onsite
2.1 communication 介绍做过的project 然后问有什么难点
2.2 hiring manager 基本就是聊聊过去的experience
2.3 design web游戏hangman
2.4 coding  一个pizza 切n刀 问最多能切几块 注意不一定要所有切线都在同一个交点. Waral 鍗氬鏈夋洿澶氭枃绔�,
              leetcode98 valid binary search tree
              实现一个maxstack 功能有pop peek peekMax popMax, popMax要求O(1) 应该是挂在这上了 最后没想出来popMax O(1)怎么做
2.5  coding reverse words in a string 和 nestedlist iterator
3. Discussion
3.1 Question: 請問design hangman到底要怎麼破啊 很常看到不知道思路
3.2 一开始什么要求都没有 就问我知不知道猜词游戏 解释了一下 说让设计一个web上玩的
于是一开始我就写了一个hangman的class 这个网上一搜有很多.1point3acres缃�
然后面试官问这个code放在哪里 我说用户开始游戏 就把code下载到本地 
每猜对或者猜错一个字母 都在本地更新
只有这轮游戏输了才发request到server更新用户的score
然后面试官问那这样如果用户想作弊 在前台就能看到是什么词了 
我说是的 那看你想让这游戏多serious了 如果就是给用户玩着玩的 那他想作弊就作吧.鏈枃鍘熷垱鑷�1point3acres璁哄潧
面试官说那假设挺serious的呢
我说那就只能存server上了 用户猜一个发一个request 面试官表示可以
然后就讨论了一下database怎么设计 我就说一个user table一个word table
然后选了sql database
然后面试官问假设500m+用户了. 鍥磋鎴戜滑@1point 3 acres
我给他算了算qps 发现不是很大 就说那现在的设计没什么问题. more info on 1point3acres.com
面试官说那假设超级popular qps特别大
就扯了memcached 多台服务器 多台数据库blahblah
基本上把自己知道的东西都往上扯 数据库sharding replica server用master slave啥的
面试官感觉你起码有这个概念 聊聊时间就过去了

2.  The coding question (using collabedit) is something like "Search a sorted array for the first element larger than k."
I had studied Data Structures and Algorithms extensively and know binary search by heart. So this is pretty easy for me.

1. A user logs in to a website with proper credentials and the user is taken to a blank page. How would you troubleshoot that?  
2. Coding: Create a stack with the usual push() & pop(), but with an additional function getMiddle() 
that returns the middle element of the stack in constant time.  

## Glassdoor Senior Software Engineer in Test March 1 2013
1. Called me and asked me a few technical questions. 
Lots of big O questions. Was asked to code an algorithm to find if there exists 2 numbers in an array that sum up to 
a specific "s" and then find the big O of this. 
Got it right but they never responded after my interview because they filled up all their positions just before 
(but the interviewer was unaware of that). 

## Glassdoor Software Engineer in Test Nov 2014 on-site 
1.  The in-person interview was 3 rounds. First was Q&A and coding, then test strategy, 
then a final round of coding and testing. 
2. Examine the inbox feature of LinkedIn, read over the given spec, and design a test suite for it.
