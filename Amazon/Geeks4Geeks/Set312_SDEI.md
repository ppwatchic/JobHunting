### First round
1. Find the kth smallest element in row wise and column wise sorted matrix. (No Heap solution)   
1.1 Use PriorityQueue to do a BFS in the matrix.  
2. There is a given data with time and number of orders at that time and it will random.  
Then there will be a query of how many orders placed between a given interval of time.  

### Second Round
1. http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimum-number-of-swaps-required-for-arranging-pairs-adjacent-to-each-other/
2. There given a list of strings out which we have to print the unique strings. Unique string is a string which is not repeated.
Third Round:

### Third Round
1. It was a discussion on my current project and the challenges I faced and how I managed when I am unable to meet the deadlines.
2. There given a 2 Lists with int values. We need to find the longest chain. Eg: L1 = { 2,7,4,8,9,10}, L2 = {1,2,8,9,4}. 
Here the solution is 2 (chain is 2,4 or 8,9). Because 7 is present in L1 which is not L2.  
Given a equi-weighted uni directed graph and need to find the max distance possible from a given node.  

### Fourth Round
1. It was again discussion on my current project.  
2. Final question of my interview: Add 1 to the integer represented by a linked list with O(n) time and O(1) space.  
First I start with the recursion and he suggested me without stack space too. 
Then I suggested for the reversing of linked list and then adding the number. 
He was again asked me without reversing of linked list. Then I came up with the solution with linear search.
