## Description
Let's say I have a simple function (fibonacci/factorial) that I need to run constantly. The largest number that I can receive
 as input will be 1,000.  
How can I improve the performance of this function call?  
 1) Not use recursion and cache the results using a data structure. (i.e. a Map) 
 

## Possible Approach
1. Using arrays to save result.
